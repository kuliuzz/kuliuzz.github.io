                                <h2>The (Eleven) Seven Summits</h2>      
                            </header>
                            <p>Everest, Aconcagua, Denali (Mount McKinley), Kibo (Kilimanjaro) and Vinson are undisputed. </p>
                            <p>On Australia there are several different opinions. Some accept only the large continental island Australia
                                 and therefore claim Mount Kosciuszko as the culmination of this continent. Not only for mountaineering
                                  reasons it is disputed by many. So others include New Zealand as part of “Oceania” and they claim Mount
                                   Cook as one of the “Seven Summits”.</p>
                            <p>But in the case of New Guinea, one cannot deny the nearness to Australia, there is even a large shelf connection
                                 and the water between it and the other Indonesian islands is much deeper! So the culmination of this island
                                  would be the most logical candidate, because also the water between Australia and New Zealand is much deeper
                                   and it is also more distant. Nowadays another opinion is that several old and new atlases define Asia’s border
                                    as the political one between Indonesia and Papua-New Guinea, and therefore Mount Wilhelm is supported. But
                                     political borders are no good rulers on geography. So the Carstensz Pyramid is from the mountaineering and
                                      the geographical point of view the best candidate to be the high point of “Oceania”.</p>
                            <p>Elbrus is orologically (separating mountain ranges and land only by water and the deepest points and saddles to
                                 the next higher mountain) connected to the High Asian mountains and not to European ranges. Its key saddle is
                                  far away in South East Iran quite near to the Pakistani border. Basically Europe are "just" parts of the large
                                   continent Eurasia, but if one separates orologically, one has definitive borders for the two European peninsulas.
                                    Skandinavia's (or Northern Europe's) border runs from the White Sea to the Baltic Sea. Southern or core Europe's
                                     border runs across the prominence saddle of Mont Blanc, then along the river Volga to the Caspian Sea. The
                                      southern border is the Kuma-Manych depression, not only in the view of most of the geographers before the Seven
                                       Summits game, but also orologically across the basin saddle of the Caspian depression over to the Black Sea!
                                        Therefore the true ruler of the European core subcontinent is of course Mont Blanc.</p>
                            <p>From these strictly logical points of view the “true” "Seven Summits" are Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kibo, Vinson,
                                 Carstensz Pyramid and Mont Blanc. The first climber, who ascended all these was Reinhold Messner, over five years
                                  before Gerhard Schmatz! This is quite ironic, because he was the one, who said in an interview in Russia, that he
                                   came to climb Elbrus, “the highest mountain of Europe” and gave the minority, who wanted to separate Europe from 
                                   Asia across the water divide and not across the land divide, power for their opinion. And of course it was
                                    understandably very welcome for the tourist industry near the Caucasus. Maybe Reinhold Messner thought to have
                                     an advantage, because he was the first of all the Seven Summiteers, who ascended Elbrus and obviously he wanted
                                      to be the first to complete the Seven Summits with Elbrus, but in this case he failed. In comparison with the
                                       "traditional" versions here are the first two climbers of all three versions.</p>
